Startup
=======

GNUstep Startup is a set of scripts to automatically build and install the
core GNUstep system.  You can run it at any time: before, during, and after
you have installed GNUstep.

If you have never installed GNUstep before, make sure to check that you
have all the prerequisite packages installed. For general prerequisites, see
the GNUstep installation guide:

http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/User/GNUstep/gnustep-howto_2.html#SEC2

For platform specific prerequisites, see:

http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/User/GNUstep/machines_toc.html

To begin, type:

InstallGNUstep

This runs configuration tests that check if your system is setup
correctly to install GNUstep. At the end of these tests, a report is
printed that gives some information on any errors or possible problems
you may have in installing GNUstep. If configure completes
sucessfully, then the script installs the GNUstep core libraries.

NOTE: This package is a compilation of the following packages:
gnustep-make
gnustep-base
gnustep-gui
gnustep-back
There is no need to install these packages after installing the Startup
package. You can proceed directly to installing GNUstep Applications after
this.

Intalling in another location
------------------------------

To install GNUstep in a non-default location, use for example:

export GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT=/usr/local/GNUstep/System

or if you are using csh:

setenv GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT /usr/local/GNUstep/System

Passing flags to make
---------------------

You can set the MAKEFLAGS environement variable to pass make flags to
InstallGNUstep. For instance:

export MAKEFILES=debug=yes

will compile all the core libraries with debugging enable.

Discussion
==========

This install script is meant to make it as easy as possible to install
a bare-bones GNUstep system. That is, it doesn't require all the optional
libraries you might want to have (SSL, etc). It also doesn't
use the art backend (at least by default).
Ideally, after this bare-bones system is installed, we could start
up a real GNUstep application which could do a much better job of doing any one
or all of the following:

1. Instructing the user how to set up a complete system
2. Downloading any additional required files
3. Compiling and installing an 'optimized' system
4. Compiling and installing useful applications.


This install script can be used in two ways. First, if you have checked
out the sources from CVS, this script expects the core directory to 
be located on the same level as the Startup directory (e.g. ../core)

If you have tar.gz files downloaded (or this comes on a CD with the
sources). The sources should be in a directory called sources in the
Startup directory (e.g. ./sources).
