Startup
=======

GNUstep Startup is a set of scripts to automatically build and install the
core GNUstep system.  You can run it at any time: before, during, and after
you have installed GNUstep.

To begin, type:

InstallGNUstep

This runs configuration tests that check if your system is setup
correctly to install GNUstep. At the end of these tests, a report is
printed that gives some information on any errors or possible problems
you may have in installing GNUstep. If configure completes
sucessfully, then the script installs the GNUstep core libraries.

Intalling in another location
------------------------------

To install GNUstep in a non-default location, use for example:

export GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT=/usr/local/GNUstep/System

or if you are using csh:

setenv GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT /usr/local/GNUstep/System
