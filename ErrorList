E090 Error
You need the GNU cc compiler to compile GNUstep

W092 Warning
Your gcc version is not an official release and may be broken.
Particularly if you are using RedHat before 7.2 or Mandrake, you should 
upgrade gcc to a newer version.

E093 Error
It appears you are using the Apple cc compiler. The Apple compiler does
not compile GNUstep. You need to install an FSF compiler, or make sure
that the FSF compiler is found first in your PATH.

E101 Error
No ld/binutils program installed. It's likely you are missing most
or all programs needed for compiling. Check your operating system for
information on installing a developer system.

W102 Warning
Make version is not recent enough or you are not using GNU
make. You may have many problems compiling and/or running GNUstep.

W103 Warning
ld/binutils version is not recent enough, on Solaris 8 or greater you
need a recent version of GNU binutils to compile GNUstep. The Solaris
ld program isn't good enough. On Solaris < 2.8 you can ignore this warning.

W104 Warning
ld/binutils version is not recent enough. Try to get a binutils version
more recent that 2.9.6

I105 Information
Could not determine binutils version. Perhaps you are working on a
system that doesn't include this information. It's probably OK to continue.

I106 Information
You have an old or nonexistent iconv implementation. iconv is not
required, but is needed for string and font encodings. It comes with
glib 2.1.2 or later.

E107 Error
No XML library support was found. The GNUstep base library will not
build without XML, unless it is specifically disabled with --disable-xml
This is done automatically on MinGW currently.

W108 Warning
Not XSLT library was found. GNUstep base uses this library for important
functions. It is not required, however, so you can continue building 
without this support.

W109 Warning 
For security reasons, your make program will not pass LD_LIBRARY_PATH
along. You may need to compile/install applications when you are logged in
as root, or use 'make LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH install'.

W125 Warning 
The OpenSSL package (libcrypto, etc) is needed to access https connections
with NSURL and for other purposes. This package is optional so you are
not required to install it.

W130 Warning
The SO_REUSEADDR socket option for controlling re-use of network
sockets immediately after shutdown appears to be broken on this
machine.  Networking code will be built without using this
feature.
The effect of this lack is that when a network service is shut
down, it cannot be re-started on the same network port until
an operating-system timeout has expired.
For servers other than gdomap, GNUstep does not normally need
a particular network port, so the problem is unlikely to arise.

E140 Error
Unable to find integer of same size as void*. If you are porting GNUstep
to a new machine please ask for help at bug-gnustep@gnu.org

E141 Error
Unable to determine type for 16-bit integer. If you are porting GNUstep
to a new machine please ask for help at bug-gnustep@gnu.org

E142 Error
Unable to determine type for 32-bit integer. If you are porting GNUstep
to a new machine please ask for help at bug-gnustep@gnu.org

E144 Error
Unable to determine type for 32-bit float. If you are porting GNUstep
to a new machine please ask for help at bug-gnustep@gnu.org

E144 Error
Unable to determine type for 64-bit float. If you are porting GNUstep
to a new machine please ask for help at bug-gnustep@gnu.org

E150 Error
You do not have the GNU Objective-C compiler installed
Check to make sure you have a full installation of the GCC
compiler that includes the Objective-C headers and libraries

E151 Error
You do not have the GNU Objective-C headers installed.
Check to make sure you have a full installation of the GCC
compiler that includes the Objective-C headers and libraries.

E155 Error
Darwin/PPC (Mac OS X) systems require libffi, but there is no libffi
installed. Please install this before installing GNUstep

I190 Information
$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT was set and has something installed there but
configure's prefix was not set to this location. I'm assuming you
want to install GNUstep somewhere else than where it is currently
installed. If not, when you run configure, set the prefix by typing
--prefix=$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT

I199 Information
GNUstep is not installed yet. Please proceed with installation of GNUstep
as long as you have resolved other errors listed here.


E270 Error
GNUstep requires the ffcall of libffi library to do invocations and DO
Make sure this library is installed (see installation instructions)
Otherwise DO will not be compatible with other systems and may cause
hard-to-trace errors. On non-ix86 it may not work at all.

E271 Error
You do not have a recent version of the libobjc library. Make sure
you either have gcc 3.x installed or install gnustep-objc.

E280 Error
I don't seem to be able to use your Objective-C compiler to produce
working binaries!  Please check your Objective-C compiler installation.
Either the Objective-C compiler part of gcc is not installed or the 
Objective-C library is not installed.

E281 Error
I don't seem to be able to use your Objective-C compiler to produce
working binaries!  Please check your Objective-C compiler installation.
For gcc-3.0.x make sure that your compiler's libgcc_s and libobjc
can be found by the dynamic linker - usually that requires you to add
the directory given by gcc -print-file-name=libobjc.so to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH or /etc/ld.so.conf.
Please refer to your compiler installation instructions for more help.

W300 Warning
You seem to have installed gnustep-make, but have not sourced the
GNUstep script. Please type "source $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh"
or use GNUstep.csh on csh shells. Ignore this if you are still installing
GNUstep. 

E400 Error
Found the tiff library but not the tiff header files. Perhaps you need
to install the tiff-devel package? tiff is required to load images with 
the GNUstep gui.

E401 Error
You need to install the TIFF library (libtiff and libtiff-devel) in order
to use the GNUstep gui.

W402 Warning
Found the jpeg library but not the jpeg header files. Perhaps you need
to install the jpeg-devel package? jpeg is required to load JPEG images with 
the GNUstep gui.

W403 Warning
You need to install the JPEG library (libjpeg)) in order to load JPEG
images with the GNUstep gui.

W408 Warning
Found the png library but not the png header files. Perhaps you need
to install the png-devel package? png is used to load PNG images with 
the GNUstep gui.

W409 Warning
You need to install the PNG library (libpng) in order to load PNG
images with the GNUstep gui.
