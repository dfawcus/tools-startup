The GNUstep Startup Package, version 0.9.1 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Startup Package?
====================================

GNUstep Startup is a compilation of the following core GNUstep packages:
gnustep-make Version 1.10.0
gnustep-base Version 1.10.1
gnustep-gui Version 0.9.4
gnustep-back Version 0.9.4

In addition, there is a set of scripts to automatically build and
install the core GNUstep system.  You can run it at any time: before,
during, and after you have installed GNUstep.

After installing GNUstep Startup, you will have a complete runtime system
for compiling and running GNUstep applications. For a complete developement
system, you would also need to install the Gorm and ProjectCenter applications.

The installation scripts have currently been tested on:

Darwin 7.x
Solaris 2.7

Note for developers and testers: You can use these scripts to build the
libraries from CVS. Just go to the Startup directory in CVS and start the
installation from there.
