The GNUstep Startup Package, version 0.12.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Startup Package?
====================================

GNUstep Startup is a compilation of the following core GNUstep packages:
gnustep-make Version 1.11.1
gnustep-base Version 1.11.1
gnustep-gui Version 0.10.1
gnustep-back Version 0.10.1

The main advantage of Startup is that it includes a script to
automatically build and install the core GNUstep system.  

After installing GNUstep Startup, you will have a complete system for
compiling and running GNUstep applications. You will, of course, need
to compile and install applications (such as GWorkspace) to actually
use GNUstep in a runtime system. For a complete developement system,
you would also need to install the Gorm and ProjectCenter
applications.

The installation scripts have been tested on:

GNU-Linux/PPC (YellowDog Linux 3.0)
Darwin/PPC 7.x
Solaris/SPARC 2.7
NetBSD/ix86
NetBSD/sparc64
Debian Unstable/ix86
Gentoo/ix86

NOTES: Windows uses should preferably use the Windows binary installer
available at www.gnustep.org. Some systems (Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo,
etc) have precompiled binaries of GNUstep available through their
normal distribution system. It may be preferable to get GNUstep this
way.

Note for developers and testers: You can use these scripts to build
the libraries from CVS. Just run the install script from the Startup
directory in CVS.

Changes in version 0.13.0
=========================

Uses new releases of the core libraries with a few patches to get things
working on MaOSX 8.X and on Cygwin. This release is binary compaticly with
the last release.

Startup script works better on MinGW.

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
