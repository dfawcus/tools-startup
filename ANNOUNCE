The GNUstep Startup Package, version 0.10.1 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Startup Package?
====================================

GNUstep Startup is a compilation of the following core GNUstep packages:
gnustep-make Version 1.10.0
gnustep-base Version 1.10.2 (with patches)
gnustep-gui Version 0.9.5
gnustep-back Version 0.9.5

The main advantage of Startup is that it includes a script to
automatically build and install the core GNUstep system.  

After installing GNUstep Startup, you will have a complete system for
compiling and running GNUstep applications. You will, of course, need
to compile and install applications (such as GWorkspace) to actually
use GNUstep in a runtime system. For a complete developement system,
you would also need to install the Gorm and ProjectCenter
applications.

The installation scripts have currently been tested on:

GNU-Linux/PPC (YellowDog Linux 3.0)
Darwin/PPC 7.x
Solaris/SPARC 2.7
NetBSD/ix86

NOTES: Windows uses should preferably use the Windows binary installer
available at www.gnustep.org. Some systems (Debian, FreeBSD, Gentoo,
etc) have precompiled binaries of GNUstep available through their
normal distribution system. It may be preferable to get GNUstep this
way.

Note for developers and testers: You can use these scripts to build the
libraries from CVS. Just go to the Startup directory in CVS and start the
installation from there.
