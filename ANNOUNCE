The GNUstep Startup Package, version 0.9.0 is now available.

What is the GNUstep Startup Package?
====================================

GNUstep Startup is a compilation of the following core GNUstep packages:
gnustep-make
gnustep-base
gnustep-gui
gnustep-back

In addition, there is a set of scripts to automatically build and
install the core GNUstep system.  You can run it at any time: before,
during, and after you have installed GNUstep.

After installing GNUstep Startup, you will have a complete runtime system
for compiling and running GNUstep applications. For a complete developement
system, you would also need to install the Gorm and ProjectCenter applications.

The installation scripts have currently been tested on:

Darwin 7.x
Solaris 2.7

Changes in version 0.9.0
=========================

Beta release. Needs testing by volunteers.


Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

The gnustep-startup distribution file has been placed on
`ftp.gnustep.org' in `pub/gnustep/core'.
